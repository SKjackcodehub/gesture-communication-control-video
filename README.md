# gesture-communication-control-video

This project aims to implement an AI-powered gesture-based communication system to control video playback using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithms in Python. 
By utilizing gestures captured through a camera feed, users can interact with a video player without the need for traditional input devices such as keyboards or mice.


Features:
Gesture Recognition: Utilizes CNN algorithms to recognize hand gestures captured through a camera feed.
Video Playback Control: Allows users to control video playback (play, pause, forward, backward) using recognized gestures.
Real-Time Interaction: Provides real-time interaction between the user and the video player based on detected gestures.
Python Implementation: Entirely implemented in Python for ease of understanding and modification.

Requirements:
Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2) for camera feed and image processing
TensorFlow or PyTorch for CNN-based gesture recognition
Video player library (e.g., VLC, OpenCV) for video playback

Usage:
Ensure your camera is properly connected to your system.
Navigate to the project directory.

Accessibility:
Free-hand       : Nothing
Start & Stop    : Start and Pause the Video
Volume_up       : Volume Increase
Volume_down     : Volume Down
Max_screen      : Maximize the Screen
Min_screen      : Minimize the Screen
Backward Skip   : Skip 5 Sec Backward
Forward Skip    : Skip 5 sec Forward

Run the main Python script:
python main.py
Follow on-screen instructions to calibrate the system (if required) and start controlling the video playback using hand gestures.
